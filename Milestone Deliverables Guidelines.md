# Milestone Deliverables Guidelines

We kindly ask you to consider the following guidelines when you submit your project milestone for evaluation. Please submit your milestone updates by email to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org).

The submission should contain the following information:

- **Project name**
- **Link to the open-source code/delivery**
- **Basic [testing guide](#testing-guide)**
- **A list of the [milestone deliverables](#milestone-deliverables)**
- **Any [additional information](#additional-information)**

## Testing Guide

Please provide detailed documentation on how to install, compile, run, and/or test the deliverable(s). Documentation must be publicly available, such as a readme file or similar. This will make it easier for the community to use or adapt this project. For installation, we prefer docker images in order to avoid problems with versions and dependencies.

## Milestone Deliverables

Please provide a detailed list of milestone deliverables. This list should align with and closely reflect the list of deliverables shown in Annex 1 of the grant contract. Each item in the list should include a link to the deliverable itself. If necessary, please highlight anything that deviates from the contract and include additional information that you think is relevant to the deliverable(s).

| Number | Deliverable | Link | Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- | ----- |
| 1.     | ...         | ...  | ...   |
| 2.     | ...         | ...  | ...   |

## Additional Information

Please include any additional comments that may be relevant for evaluation.
