## About 

The Neo General Grants Program is primarily focused on funding the development of tools and infrastructure for the Neo Blockchain. For more info about other **Neo Grants**, please visit our [Neo Grants page](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants) on GitHub to get detailed information. 

The Neo Foundation tends to support teams for excellent blockchain software development initiatives. We expect teams and deliverables to be **adoption driven**, **developer friendly**, **deliver on-time** and **provide value to the Neo ecosystem**. For more specific information on our funding priorities, please take a look at the [Neo Stack](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Neo%20Stack.md) and  our  [Accepted Grant Applications](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Accepted%20Grant%20Applications.md). 




## Funding 

### Project Funding
The average funding for a project is around **$5,000** to **$50,000**, and the typical maximum funding is **$100,000**. However, if the project can provide extraordinary value to the Neo ecosystem, additional funding may be possible. Generally, the Neo Foundation decides the funding for a project based on the time, difficulty, importance or priority to the Neo ecosystem and the developer-friendly nature of the project. Most of the projects should be expected to be completed within **6 months**. 

Grants may be applied more than once for new projects with complexity, or for existing projects with major new capabilities or upgrades. For existing projects, team need to complete and deliver on the previous grant as described in their application before receiving additional funds. The Neo Foundation Grants Committee will decide whether to approve the new grant application.


### Sustaining Engineering
Usually the team should continue to maintain the project properly for one year after the development, including the normal operation of the project, fixing bugs, incremental upgrades and user support, etc. An **additional 10%** of the project funding will be distributed to the team towards the annual maintenance.

If an existing project requires major upgrade, such as adding a large number of new functions/capabilities or adapting to a major upgrade with the protocol layer (such as Neo2 to Neo3), the team can apply for a new grant.
If a project that has received a grant can no longer be properly maintained, its original team is under obligation to assist the new team with comprehensive project migration and relevant handover. Expenses during periods of non-maintenance will be deducted. If the team is unwilling to help with the migration, full maintaining fee will be withheld.



## Assessment Criteria
1. **Open source**

	All projects' repositories should be open source on GitHub with preferred license, such as MIT or Apache 2.0.
	
2. **On-time delivery**

	All projects should have a clear plan with milestones within 6 months. The funding will be distributed after milestone-based evaluation is satisfied at each stage. 10% of the milestone funding will be deducted if the project is delayed beyond 10%-30% of the expected completion time, and 20% of the milestone funding will be deducted for delays exceeding 30% beyond the expected completion time.

3. **Development quality** 

	The project should be able to achieve the desired goals, and all the planned functions/capabilities should be fully implemented and tested. In addition, the developer experience, performance, scalability, security and coordination with mainstream industry standards will be taken into account for the quality of each milestone deliverable.

4. **Detailed documentation**

	All projects should provide detailed documentation, and are recommended to provide tutorials with either docs or videos. The documentation should include project introduction, usage scenarios & examples, reference implementation and FAQ. Comprehensive documentation should be provided at the time of final delivery. 

5. **Neo family branding**

	All projects are recommended to incorporate Neo branding related design elements into the project design. For details, please refer to [Neo presskit](https://neo.org/presskit).
	
6. **Real-world Adoption**
	
	All project should consider real-world usage scenarios. If a project is widely adopted by developers and users with large developer/user base, we will provide additional rewards.

## Application & Evaluation
### Grant Application

Use the [Grant Application Template](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Grant%20Application%20Template.md) to fill in the details of the proposed project and send to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org). There will be an automated reply once the email is received, and within two weeks of receipt of the application the committee will contact the team.

### Application Review

The Neo Foundation Grants Committee may comment and request changes to the proposal after the review of the grant application. On reaching agreement, the committee will send feedback to inform the team of the final decision and corresponding requirements.

### Milestone Delivery

For approved grant application, you can refer to [Milestone Deliverables Guidelines](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Milestone%20Deliverables%20Guidelines.md) and send it to [grants@neo.org](mailto:grants@neo.org).

### Milestone Review

The Committee may comment and request changes to the milestone deliverables. There will be potential requests for necessary adjustments or optional modification recommendations after the review. All the necessary change requests should be fully met before distributing milestone funding.

### Milestone Payment

After all requirements are met for the milestone review, the payment will be sent within two weeks.
