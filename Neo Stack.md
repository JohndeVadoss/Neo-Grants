## About
The Neo stack is a set of software (sub)systems, tools and components that collectively empower and enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Neo Blockchain. The Neo Blockchain is currently being upgraded to Neo3, and all listed projects support Neo3.

The Neo vision is to build the premier Digital Asset platform to realize the Smart Economy. Hence, the Neo Stack architecture aims to enable broad developer tooling and productivity for digital asset issuance and circulation at scale.



## Funding
In order to promote the growth and evolution of the Neo ecosystem, the Neo Foundation offers comprehensive [Neo Grants](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants) to support software development and research efforts related to Neo. 

[Neo General Grants Program](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Neo%20General%20Grants%20Program.md) is focused on funding projects to build out the layers of the Neo Stack. The Neo Foundation tends to support teams for excellent blockchain software development. **Projects that fill gaps in the current ecosystem, or projects that demonstrate extraordinary value over existing projects, will be given priority.** Such value could be in many forms including but not limited to differentiated functionality, superior user experience, attracting new developers and users to the ecosystem or leading to a higher likelihood of the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.




## Layers of Neo Stack
This is an illustrative view of the Neo Stack. We look for innovative, pioneering approaches to enhance the Neo Stack. If you are looking for direction, please see below for an illustrative view of the layers that comprise the Neo stack.

If you believe that we should sponsor the development of certain tools/projects related to Neo that aren't currently in the [Neo Stack](https://github.com/Grace-Gui/Neo-Grants/blob/master/Neo%20Stack.md), then please feel free to submit a new request addressing the proposal. We will review your proposal and if the team deems it to be a priority then it will be added to the Neo Stack.
